Q. Write a program to implement arithmatic operators.
 #include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
 float a,b;
 printf("Welocome to the program for basic arthimatic operators.");
 printf("Please enter your first variable.");
 scanf ("%f", &a);
 printf("Please enter your first variable.");
 scanf("%f", &b);
 printf("Your numbers are =%f", a , b);
 float sum = a+b;
 printf("Sum of the two number is %f", &sum)

 float diff;
 if(a>b)
 {
  diff = a-b;
  printf("Difference of two numbers is %f", &diff);
  float quotient = a/b;
  printf("Quotient of the divison is %f", &quotient);
  float reminder = a%b;
  printf("Remainder of the divison is %f", &reminder);
 }
 else
 {
   diff = b-a;
  printf("Difference of two numbers is %f", &diff);
  float quotient = b/a;
  printf("Quotient of the divison is %f", &quotient);
  float reminder = b%a;
  printf("Remainder of the divison is %f", &reminder);
 }
 }
}
